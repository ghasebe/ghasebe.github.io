::: {.callout-note}
A few students asked me if I could upload Professor Welzl's slides from last spring semester.
I asked him and he kindly agreed. Please note that material covered on these slides must not be
part of this semesters lecture. It should only be seen as additional material. For exam relevant topics, please refer to the official lecture material.
