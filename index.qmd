Hi, I’m Georg, a BSc student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

I’m currently a teaching assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures in Fall 2024. Previously, I’ve also been a TA for Algorithms and Probability (Spring 2024) and Algorithms and Data Structures (Fall 2023).

I always try to make my exercise classes engaging and fun. This site is where I share materials, exercises, and other resources.

Feel free to contact me at `georg dot hasebe at inf dot ethz dot ch`.
